##Why this Project?
This project gives me an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

##What Did I Learn?
Through this project, I learned to:
 - understand the fundamentals of Android design.
 - apply material design guidelines to a mobile application.
 - separate an interface into surfaces.
 - effectively use transitions and motion.
